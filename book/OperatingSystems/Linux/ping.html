<p>NAME
ping - send ICMP ECHO_REQUEST to network hosts</p>
<p>SYNOPSIS</p>
<pre><code>   ping [-aAbBdCDfhHLnOqrRUvV346] [-c count] [-e identifier] [-F flowlabel] [-i interval] [-I interface] [-l preload]
        [-m mark] [-M pmtudisc_option] [-N nodeinfo_option] [-w deadline] [-W timeout] [-p pattern] [-Q tos] [-s packetsize]
        [-S sndbuf] [-t ttl] [-T timestamp option] [hop...] {destination}
</code></pre>
<p>DESCRIPTION
ping uses the ICMP protocol's mandatory ECHO_REQUEST datagram to elicit an ICMP ECHO_RESPONSE from a host or gateway.
ECHO_REQUEST datagrams (“pings”) have an IP and ICMP header, followed by a struct timeval and then an arbitrary number of
“pad” bytes used to fill out the packet.</p>
<pre><code>   ping works with both IPv4 and IPv6. Using only one of them explicitly can be enforced by specifying -4 or -6.

   ping can also send IPv6 Node Information Queries (RFC4620). Intermediate hops may not be allowed, because IPv6 source
   routing was deprecated (RFC5095).
</code></pre>
<p>OPTIONS
-3
RTT precision (do not round up the result time).</p>
<pre><code>   -4
       Use IPv4 only.

   -6
       Use IPv6 only.

   -a
       Audible ping.

   -A
       Adaptive ping. Interpacket interval adapts to round-trip time, so that effectively not more than one (or more, if
       preload is set) unanswered probe is present in the network. The default interval is 2 ms, for more info see option -i.
       On networks with low RTT this mode is essentially equivalent to flood mode.

   -b
       Allow pinging a broadcast address.

   -B
       Do not allow ping to change source address of probes. The address is bound to one selected when ping starts.

   -c count
       Stop after sending count ECHO_REQUEST packets. With deadline option, ping waits for count ECHO_REPLY packets, until the
       timeout expires.

   -C
       Call connect() syscall on socket creation.

   -d
       Set the SO_DEBUG option on the socket being used. Essentially, this socket option is not used by Linux kernel.

   -D
       Print timestamp (unix time + microseconds as in gettimeofday) before each line.

   -e identifier
       Set the identification field of ECHO_REQUEST. Value 0 implies using raw socket (not supported on ICMP datagram socket).
       The value of the field may be printed with -v option.

   -f
       Flood ping. For every ECHO_REQUEST sent a period “.” is printed, while for every ECHO_REPLY received a backspace is
       printed. This provides a rapid display of how many packets are being dropped. If interval is not given, it sets
       interval to zero and outputs packets as fast as they come back or one hundred times per second, whichever is more. Only
       the super-user may use this option with zero interval.

   -F flow label
       IPv6 only. Allocate and set 20 bit flow label (in hex) on echo request packets. If value is zero, kernel allocates
       random flow label.

   -h
       Show help.

   -H
       Force DNS name resolution for the output. Useful for numeric destination, or -f option, which by default do not perform
       it. It can also help to workaround DNS resolution problems. Override previously defined -n option. See also
       IPUTILS_PING_PTR_LOOKUP environment variable.

   -i interval
       Wait interval seconds between sending each packet. Real number allowed with dot as a decimal separator (regardless
       locale setup). The default is to wait for one second between each packet normally, or not to wait in flood mode. Only
       super-user may set interval to values less than 2 ms. Broadcast and multicast ping have even higher limitation for
       regular user: minimum is 1 sec.

   -I interface
       interface is either an address, an interface name or a VRF name. If interface is an address, it sets source address to
       specified interface address. If interface is an interface name, it sets source interface to specified interface. If
       interface is a VRF name, each packet is routed using the corresponding routing table; in this case, the -I option can
       be repeated to specify a source address. NOTE: For IPv6, when doing ping to a link-local scope address, link
       specification (by the '%'-notation in destination, or by this option) can be used but it is no longer required.

   -l preload
       If preload is specified, ping sends that many packets not waiting for reply. Only the super-user may select preload
       more than 3.

   -L
       Suppress loopback of multicast packets. This flag only applies if the ping destination is a multicast address.

   -m mark
       use mark to tag the packets going out. This is useful for variety of reasons within the kernel such as using policy
       routing to select specific outbound processing. CAP_NET_ADMIN or CAP_NET_RAW (since Linux 5.17) capability is required,
       see socket(7).

   -M pmtudisc_opt
       Select Path MTU Discovery strategy.  pmtudisc_option may be either do (set DF flag but subject to PMTU checks by
       kernel, packets too large will be rejected), want (do PMTU discovery, fragment locally when packet size is large),
       probe (set DF flag and bypass PMTU checks, useful for probing), or dont (do not set DF flag).

   -N nodeinfo_option
       IPv6 only. Send IPv6 Node Information Queries (RFC4620), instead of Echo Request. CAP_NET_RAW capability is required.

       help
           Show help for NI support.

       name
           Queries for Node Names.

       ipv6
           Queries for IPv6 Addresses. There are several IPv6 specific flags.

           ipv6-global
               Request IPv6 global-scope addresses.

           ipv6-sitelocal
               Request IPv6 site-local addresses.

           ipv6-linklocal
               Request IPv6 link-local addresses.

           ipv6-all
               Request IPv6 addresses on other interfaces.

       ipv4
           Queries for IPv4 Addresses. There is one IPv4 specific flag.

           ipv4-all
               Request IPv4 addresses on other interfaces.

       subject-ipv6=ipv6addr
           IPv6 subject address.

       subject-ipv4=ipv4addr
           IPv4 subject address.

       subject-name=nodename
           Subject name. If it contains more than one dot, fully-qualified domain name is assumed.

       subject-fqdn=nodename
           Subject name. Fully-qualified domain name is always assumed.

   -n
       Numeric output only. No attempt will be made to lookup symbolic names for host addresses (no reverse DNS resolution).
       This is the default for numeric destination or -f option. Override previously defined -H option. See also
       IPUTILS_PING_PTR_LOOKUP environment variable.

   -O
       Report outstanding ICMP ECHO reply before sending next packet. This is useful together with the timestamp -D to log
       output to a diagnostic file and search for missing answers.

   -p pattern
       You may specify up to 16 “pad” bytes to fill out the packet you send. This is useful for diagnosing data-dependent
       problems in a network. For example, -p ff will cause the sent packet to be filled with all ones.

   -q
       Quiet output. Nothing is displayed except the summary lines at startup time and when finished.

   -Q tos
       Set Quality of Service -related bits in ICMP datagrams.  tos can be decimal (ping only) or hex number.

       In RFC2474, these fields are interpreted as 8-bit Differentiated Services (DS), consisting of: bits 0-1 (2 lowest bits)
       of separate data, and bits 2-7 (highest 6 bits) of Differentiated Services Codepoint (DSCP). In RFC2481 and RFC3168,
       bits 0-1 are used for ECN.

       Historically (RFC1349, obsoleted by RFC2474), these were interpreted as: bit 0 (lowest bit) for reserved (currently
       being redefined as congestion control), 1-4 for Type of Service and bits 5-7 (highest bits) for Precedence.

   -r
       Bypass the normal routing tables and send directly to a host on an attached interface. If the host is not on a
       directly-attached network, an error is returned. This option can be used to ping a local host through an interface that
       has no route through it provided the option -I is also used.

   -R
       ping only. Record route. Includes the RECORD_ROUTE option in the ECHO_REQUEST packet and displays the route buffer on
       returned packets. Note that the IP header is only large enough for nine such routes. Many hosts ignore or discard this
       option.

   -s packetsize
       Specifies the number of data bytes to be sent. The default is 56, which translates into 64 ICMP data bytes when
       combined with the 8 bytes of ICMP header data. The maximum allowed value is 65507 for IPv4 (65467 when -R or -T or
       Intermediate hops) or 65527 for IPv6, but most systems limit this to a smaller, system-dependent number.

   -S sndbuf
       Set socket sndbuf. If not specified, it is selected to buffer not more than one packet.

   -t ttl
       ping only. Set the IP Time to Live.

   -T timestamp option
       Set special IP timestamp options.  timestamp option may be either tsonly (only timestamps), tsandaddr (timestamps and
       addresses) or tsprespec host1 [host2 [host3 [host4]]] (timestamp prespecified hops).

   -U
       Print full user-to-user latency (the old behaviour). Normally ping prints network round trip time, which can be
       different f.e. due to DNS failures.

   -v
       Verbose output. Do not suppress DUP replies when pinging multicast address.

   -V
       Show version and exit.

   -w deadline
       Specify a timeout, in seconds, before ping exits regardless of how many packets have been sent or received. In this
       case ping does not stop after count packet are sent, it waits either for deadline expire or until count probes are
       answered or for some error notification from network.

   -W timeout
       Time to wait for a response, in seconds. The option affects only timeout in absence of any responses, otherwise ping
       waits for two RTTs. Real number allowed with dot as a decimal separator (regardless locale setup). 0 means infinite
       timeout.

   When using ping for fault isolation, it should first be run on the local host, to verify that the local network interface
   is up and running. Then, hosts and gateways further and further away should be “pinged”. Round-trip times and packet loss
   statistics are computed. If duplicate packets are received, they are not included in the packet loss calculation, although
   the round trip time of these packets is used in calculating the minimum/average/maximum/mdev round-trip time numbers.

   Population standard deviation (mdev), essentially an average of how far each ping RTT is from the mean RTT. The higher mdev
   is, the more variable the RTT is (over time). With a high RTT variability, you will have speed issues with bulk transfers
   (they will take longer than is strictly speaking necessary, as the variability will eventually cause the sender to wait for
   ACKs) and you will have middling to poor VoIP quality.

   When the specified number of packets have been sent (and received) or if the program is terminated with a SIGINT, a brief
   summary is displayed. Shorter current statistics can be obtained without termination of process with signal SIGQUIT.

   This program is intended for use in network testing, measurement and management. Because of the load it can impose on the
   network, it is unwise to use ping during normal operations or from automated scripts.

<p>ENVIRONMENT
IPUTILS_PING_PTR_LOOKUP environment      variable set to 0 disable reverse DNS resolution (PTR lookup) by default.       It
will be overrided by -H or -n option.
.SH "EXIT STATUS"</p>
<pre><code>   If ping does not receive any reply packets at all it will exit with code 1. If a packet count and deadline are both
   specified, and fewer than count packets are received by the time the deadline has arrived, it will also exit with code 1.
   On other error it exits with code 2. Otherwise it exits with code 0. This makes it possible to use the exit code to see if
   a host is alive or not.
</code></pre>
<p>IPV6 LINK-LOCAL DESTINATIONS
For IPv6, when the destination address has link-local scope and ping is using ICMP datagram sockets, the output interface
must be specified. When ping is using raw sockets, it is not strictly necessary to specify the output interface but it
should be done to avoid ambiguity when there are multiple possible output interfaces.</p>
<pre><code>   There are two ways to specify the output interface:

   • using the % notation
       The destination address is postfixed with % and the output interface name or ifindex, for example:

       ping fe80::5054:ff:fe70:67bc%eth0

       ping fe80::5054:ff:fe70:67bc%2

   • using the -I option
       When using ICMP datagram sockets, this method is supported since the following kernel versions: 5.17, 5.15.19, 5.10.96,
       5.4.176, 4.19.228, 4.14.265. Also it is not supported on musl libc.
</code></pre>
<p>ICMP PACKET DETAILS
An IP header without options is 20 bytes. An ICMP ECHO_REQUEST packet contains an additional 8 bytes worth of ICMP header
followed by an arbitrary amount of data. When a packetsize is given, this indicates the size of this extra piece of data
(the default is 56). Thus the amount of data received inside of an IP packet of type ICMP ECHO_REPLY will always be 8 bytes
more than the requested data space (the ICMP header).</p>
<pre><code>   If the data space is at least of size of struct timeval ping uses the beginning bytes of this space to include a timestamp
   which it uses in the computation of round trip times. If the data space is shorter, no round trip times are given.
</code></pre>
<p>DUPLICATE AND DAMAGED PACKETS
ping will report duplicate and damaged packets. Duplicate packets should never occur, and seem to be caused by
inappropriate link-level retransmissions. Duplicates may occur in many situations and are rarely (if ever) a good sign,
although the presence of low levels of duplicates may not always be cause for alarm.</p>
<pre><code>   Damaged packets are obviously serious cause for alarm and often indicate broken hardware somewhere in the ping packet's
   path (in the network or in the hosts).
</code></pre>
<p>ID COLLISIONS
Unlike TCP and UDP, which use port to uniquely identify the recipient to deliver data, ICMP uses identifier field (ID) for
identification. Therefore, if on the same machine, at the same time, two ping processes use the same ID, echo reply can be
delivered to a wrong recipient. This is a known problem due to the limited size of the 16-bit ID field. That is a
historical limitation of the protocol that cannot be fixed at the moment unless we encode an ID into the ping packet
payload.  ping prints DIFFERENT ADDRESS error and packet loss is negative.</p>
<pre><code>   ping uses PID to get unique number. The default value of /proc/sys/kernel/pid_max is 32768. On the systems that use ping
   heavily and with pid_max greater than 65535 collisions are bound to happen.
</code></pre>
<p>TRYING DIFFERENT DATA PATTERNS
The (inter)network layer should never treat packets differently depending on the data contained in the data portion.
Unfortunately, data-dependent problems have been known to sneak into networks and remain undetected for long periods of
time. In many cases the particular pattern that will have problems is something that doesn't have sufficient “transitions”,
such as all ones or all zeros, or a pattern right at the edge, such as almost all zeros. It isn't necessarily enough to
specify a data pattern of all zeros (for example) on the command line because the pattern that is of interest is at the
data link level, and the relationship between what you type and what the controllers transmit can be complicated.</p>
<pre><code>   This means that if you have a data-dependent problem you will probably have to do a lot of testing to find it. If you are
   lucky, you may manage to find a file that either can't be sent across your network or that takes much longer to transfer
   than other similar length files. You can then examine this file for repeated patterns that you can test using the -p option
   of ping.
</code></pre>
<p>TTL DETAILS
The TTL value of an IP packet represents the maximum number of IP routers that the packet can go through before being
thrown away. In current practice you can expect each router in the Internet to decrement the TTL field by exactly one.</p>
<pre><code>   The TTL field for TCP packets may take various values. The maximum possible value of this field is 255, a recommended
   initial value is 64. For more information, see the TCP/Lower-Level Interface section of RFC9293.

   In normal operation ping prints the TTL value from the packet it receives. When a remote system receives a ping packet, it
   can do one of three things with the TTL field in its response:

       • Not change it; this is what Berkeley Unix systems did before the 4.3BSD Tahoe release. In this case the TTL value in
       the received packet will be 255 minus the number of routers in the round-trip path.

       • Set it to 255; this is what current Berkeley Unix systems do. In this case the TTL value in the received packet will
       be 255 minus the number of routers in the path from the remote system to the pinging host.

       • Set it to some other value. Some machines use the same value for ICMP packets that they use for TCP packets, for
       example either 30 or 60. Others may use completely wild values.
</code></pre>
<p>BUGS
• Many Hosts and Gateways ignore the RECORD_ROUTE option.</p>
<pre><code>       • The maximum IP header length is too small for options like RECORD_ROUTE to be completely useful. There's not much
       that can be done about this, however.

       • Flood pinging is not recommended in general, and flood pinging the broadcast address should only be done under very
       controlled conditions.

<p>HISTORY
The ping command appeared in 4.3BSD.</p>
<pre><code>   The version described here is its descendant specific to Linux.

   As of version s20150815, the ping6 binary doesn't exist anymore. It has been merged into ping. Creating a symlink named
   ping6 pointing to ping will result in the same functionality as before.
</code></pre>
<p>SECURITY
ping requires CAP_NET_RAW capability to be executed 1) if the program is used for non-echo queries (see -N option) or when
the identification field set to 0 for ECHO_REQUEST (see -e), or 2) if kernel does not support ICMP datagram sockets, or 3)
if the user is not allowed to create an ICMP echo socket. The program may be used as set-uid root.</p>
<p>AVAILABILITY
ping is part of iputils package.</p>
