            <p>Windows event logs are the gateway to understanding suspicious activity, making these event log analysis tools essential for beginner blue teamers.</p>
            
            <h3>What are event log analysis tools? </h3>
            <p>Windows event logs are a record of events that have occurred on a computer running the Windows OS. 
            They include information about the system, applications running on it, providers, services, and more.
            Event log analysis tools are software that gather and study log data from different sources like servers, network devices, and applications. They come with features like watching logs in real time, sending alerts, and visualizing data.
            Specialized log analysis tools can automate the process, analyzing logs without the need to comb through them manually, making the analysis process faster and easier.</p>
           
            <h3>Why do we analyze Windows event logs? </h3>
            <p>Many organizations use log analysis tools for security purposes and compliance. They provide insights into user activity and can help detect any potential security breaches, such as attempted hacks.</p>
            <p>By analyzing these logs, we can build a timeline of what happened and even spot weaknesses in our systems. This is a valuable tool for all blue teamers to better understand system weaknesses and how to prevent them. </p>
            <h4>The benefits of using event log analysis tools</h4>
            <p>Tools can make your job much easier and be a powerful aid when spotting suspicious activity in event logs. There are potentially hundreds of thousands of event logs to shift through, which is virtually impossible to do manually. </p>
            <p>Here are some more key benefits: </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Reduces manual analysis workload:</strong> Streamlines the collection, parsing, and analysis of log data through automation, saving more time than manual processes.</li>
                <li><strong>Advanced features:</strong> Capabilities such as real-time monitoring, alerting, and visualization make it easier to pinpoint and address issues, enhance security measures, and optimize overall system performance.</li>
                <li><strong>Elevated security and compliance: </strong>  Identify security incidents, including attempted breaches or unauthorized access to sensitive data, and utilize this information to fortify security measures. Log analysis tools will also play a crucial role in meeting regulatory compliance requirements by establishing a centralized hub for storing log data.</li>
                <li><strong>Informed security decision-making: </strong> Extract valuable insights that inform security decisions.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>But we must not fully surrender to tools and allow them to do our jobs for us. Cybersecurity professionals should master the thought processes and techniques behind the tools.</p>
            <p>Human intuition might tell you more about a vulnerability than a tool could.</p>
            <p>You must always read between the lines, for example, a log analysis tool might not alert you of eventID 4624 (successful logon), but if this logon happened at a strange time of day, your intuition might ring alarm bells to dig a little deeper.</p>

            <h3>5 essential Windows event log analysis tools (+1 bonus tool)</h3>
            <p>There’s a seemingly endless pool of event log analysis tools out there. Which ones should you prioritize learning as blue teamer? 
            We’re here to narrow down your search with five essential tools to help you analyze, identify, and respond to security incidents. 
            The following log analysis tools specialize in security. Use them for real-time security log analysis and post-incident forensic analysis.</p>
            <h4>1. Splunk</h4>
            <p>Splunk is a data analytics software solution known for its ability to ingest, index, analyze, and visualize massive amounts of machine data. It can drive a wide range of initiatives, encompassing cybersecurity, compliance, data pipelines, IT monitoring, observability, as well as overall IT and business management.

            When it comes to cybersecurity, Splunk can play a crucial role as a log management solution, but its true value lies in its analytics-driven Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) capabilities. </p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Timeline: </strong>  Analyze log data over a specific period. This enables you to identify patterns, trends, anomalies, and track improvements. Reflecting your system’s health.</li>
                <li><strong>Log metricization:</strong> Report on performance and operational metrics calculated from log data, such as the number of errors, the volume of traffic, or the response time of a system.</li>
                <li><strong>Aggregate logs to groups and fields: </strong> Generate statistics such as totals and averages across related logs, helping to visualize problems.</li>
                <li><strong>Logging rules: </strong>Assign log rules in Splunk, such as unlimited records and search time limits.</li>
            </ul>    
            <h3>2. Elastic</h3>
            <p>The Elastic Stack, created by Elastic, is an open-source collection of mainly three applications: Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana. 

            The apps combine to offer users comprehensive search and visualization capabilities for real-time analysis and exploration of log file sources.

            For example, an analyst could use Elasticsearch and Logstash to collect log data from servers, applications, and network devices, and then use Kibana to create dashboards and charts that show the performance and usage of the system over time.

            Specific events, patterns, and anomalies can then be identified.</p>
